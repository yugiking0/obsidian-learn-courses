## Admonitions

Admonitions are frequently used in documentation to call attention to warnings, notes, and tips. Markdown doesn‚Äôt provide special syntax for admonitions, and most Markdown applications don‚Äôt provide support for admonitions (one exception is¬†[MkDocs](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mkdocs/)).

However, if you need to add admonitions, you might be able to use¬†[blockquotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1)¬†with¬†[emoji](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#emoji)¬†and¬†[emphasis](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#emphasis)¬†to create something that looks similar to the admonitions you see on other websites.

```
> :warning: **Warning:** Do not push the big red button.

> :memo: **Note:** Sunrises are beautiful.

> :bulb: **Tip:** Remember to appreciate the little things in life.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†**Warning:**¬†Do not push the big red button.

> üìù¬†**Note:**¬†Sunrises are beautiful.

> üí°¬†**Tip:**¬†Remember to appreciate the little things in life.

## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a¬†`>`¬†in front of a paragraph.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a¬†`>`¬†on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
> 
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Nested Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a¬†`>>`¬†in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
> 
> > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Blockquotes with Other Elements

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to experiment to see which ones work.

```
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> #### The quarterly results look great!
> 
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
> 
> _Everything_¬†is going according to¬†**plan**.
