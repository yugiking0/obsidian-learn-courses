### 1.2.8 Network Device Documentation

Network device documentation should contain accurate, up-to-date records of the network hardware and software. Documentation should include all pertinent information about the network devices.

Many organizations create documents with tables or spreadsheets to capture relevant device information.

#### End-System Documentation [[3 - End-System Documentation]]

End-system documentation focuses on the hardware and software used in servers, network management consoles, and user workstations. An incorrectly configured end-system can have a negative impact on the overall performance of a network. For this reason, having access to end-system device documentation can be very useful when troubleshooting.

This table displays a sample of information that could be recorded in an end-system device document.
