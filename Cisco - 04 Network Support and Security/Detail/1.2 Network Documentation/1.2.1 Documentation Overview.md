# Network Documentation

### 1.2.1 Documentation Overview

As with any complex activity like network troubleshooting, you will need to start with good documentation. Accurate and complete network documentation is required to effectively monitor and troubleshoot networks.

Common network documentation includes the following:

- Physical and logical network topology diagrams
- Network device documentation that records all pertinent device information
- Network performance baseline documentation

All network documentation should be kept in a single location, either as hard copy or on the network on a protected server. Backup documentation should be maintained and kept in a separate location.
