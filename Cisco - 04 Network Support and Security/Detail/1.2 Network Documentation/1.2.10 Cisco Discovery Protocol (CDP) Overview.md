### 1.2.10 Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) Overview

The first thing you want to know about your network is what is in it? Where are these components? How are they connected? Basically, you need a map. This topic explains how you can use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) to create a map of your network.

CDP is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 protocol that is used to gather information about Cisco devices which share the same data link. CDP is media and protocol independent and runs on all Cisco devices, such as routers, switches, and access servers.

The device sends periodic CDP advertisements to connected devices, as shown in the figure.
