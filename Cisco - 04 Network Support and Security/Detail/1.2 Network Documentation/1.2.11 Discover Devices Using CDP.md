1.2.11 Discover Devices Using CDP

Consider the lack of documentation in the topology shown in the figure. The network administrator only knows that R1 is connected to another device.

The figure shows a router labeled R1 connected to a cloud labeled with a question mark.

![[Pasted image 20230922161134.png]]

With CDP enabled on the network, the **show cdp neighbors** command can be used to determine the network layout, as shown in the output.

```node
R1# show cdp neighborsCapability Codes: 
R - Router, T - Trans Bridge, B - Source Route Bridge                  
S - Switch, H - Host, I - IGMP, r - Repeater, 
P - Phone,                  D - Remote, 
C - CVTA, M - Two-port Mac Relay  Device 

ID        Local Intrfce     Holdtme    Capability  Platform  Port IDS1               Gig 0/0/1           179         S I      WS-C3560- Fas 0/5
```

No information is available regarding the rest of the network. The **show cdp neighbors** command provides helpful information about each CDP neighbor device, including the following:

- **Device identifiers** - This is the host name of the neighbor device (S1).
- **Port identifier** - This is the name of the local and remote port (G0/0/1 and F0/5, respectively).
- **Capabilities list** - This shows whether the device is a router or a switch (S for switch; I for IGMP is beyond scope for this course). 
- **Platform** - This is the hardware platform of the device (WS-C3560 for Cisco Catalyst 3560 switch).

The output shows that there is another Cisco device, S1, connected to the G0/0/1 interface on R1. Furthermore, S1 is connected through its F0/5 port, as shown in the updated topology.

The figure shows a router labeled R1 connected to a switch labeled S1. S1 is connected to a cloud labeled with a question mark.

The network administrator uses **show cdp neighbors detail** to discover the IP address for S1. As displayed in the output, the address for S1 is 192.168.1.2.

By accessing S1 either remotely through SSH, or physically through the console port, the network administrator can determine what other devices are connected to S1, as displayed in the output of the **show cdp neighbors** in the figure.

```node
S1# show cdp neighbors
Capability Codes: 
R - Router, T - Trans Bridge, B - Source Route Bridge                  
S - Switch, H - Host, I - IGMP, r - Repeater, P - Phone,                  
D - Remote, C - CVTA, M - Two-port Mac

```

The output displays the specifics of the connection with R1. It also displays S2, another switch that S1 is connected to. Specifically, the output specifies that S2 is a Catalyst 2960 switch using F0/1 to connect to the F0/1 interface on S1.

The figure shows a router labeled R1 connected to a switch labeled S1. S1 is connected to another switch labeled S2.

Again, the network administrator can use **show cdp neighbors detail** to discover the IP address for S2, and then remotely access it. After a successful login, the network administrator uses the **show cdp neighbors** command to discover if there are more devices.

```node
S2# show cdp neighbors
Capability Codes: 
R - Router, T - Trans Bridge, B - Source Route Bridge                  
S - Switch, H - Host, I - IGMP, r - Repeater, 
P - Phone,                  D - Remote, C - CVTA, 
M - Two-port Mac 

RelayDevice ID   Local Intrfce  Holdtme   Capability  Platform  Port ID
S1               Fas 0/1         141       S I        WS-C3560- Fas 0/1
```
![[Pasted image 20230922162230.png]]
The only device connected to S2 is S1. Therefore, there are no more devices to discover in the topology. The network administrator can now update the documentation to reflect the discovered devices.
