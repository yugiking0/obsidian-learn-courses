1.2.4 Enterprise Network Topologies

Two types of network topologies that you have learned about are:

- Physical network topology
- Logical network topology

The figure displays a sample physical topology for a small sample network. The topology identifies the physical location and function of the devices.

#### Physical Topology

The figure displays a sample logical topology for the same small sample network. Notice the figure displays connecting interfaces and the Layer 3 network addressing scheme.

#### Logical Topology

Enterprise network topologies are similar but larger in scale and complexity. They will also typically include additional network topology diagrams.

In a previous course you learned about hierarchical network design including the access, distribution and core layers. This is one of several architecture models used in enterprise networks that can help guide you in creating and maintaining an effective design strategy. These models are not templates as each network is different in size, complexity, requirements, and budget.

This figure shows a high-level view of how different parts of an enterprise network connect along its connection to its cloud provider.

For an enterprise network, your network documentation will typically include several network topology diagrams showing different levels of detail and different types of information.

Different topology diagrams may include:

- Physical layout and connections 
- IP address and VLAN management 
- Security and VPN policies 
- Cloud services and management 
- Routing policies 
- Remote access policies for remote and hybrid workers
