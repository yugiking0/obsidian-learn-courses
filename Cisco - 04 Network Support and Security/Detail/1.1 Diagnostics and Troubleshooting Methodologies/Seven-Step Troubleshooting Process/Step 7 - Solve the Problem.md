# Solve the Problem

When the problem is solved, inform the users and anyone involved in the troubleshooting process that the problem has been resolved. Other IT team members should be informed of the solution. It is important to properly document the cause and solution as this can assist other support technicians to prevent and solve similar problems in the future.
