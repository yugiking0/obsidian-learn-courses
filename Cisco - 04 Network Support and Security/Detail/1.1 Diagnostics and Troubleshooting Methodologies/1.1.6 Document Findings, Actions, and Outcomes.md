### 1.1.6 Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes

After troubleshooting and resolving all issues, it is important to complete the troubleshooting process by documenting all information.

A technician must document the:

- **Problem** - Includes the initial report of the problem, a description of the symptoms, information gathered and any other information that would help resolve similar problems.
- **Solution** - Includes the steps taken to resolve the problem.
- **Commands and Tools Used** - Include the commands and tools used in diagnosing the problem and solving the problem.

Verify the solution with the customer. If the customer is available, demonstrate how the solution has corrected their problem. Have the customer test the solution and try to reproduce the problem. When the customer can verify that the problem has been resolved, you can update the documentation with any new information provided by the customer.
