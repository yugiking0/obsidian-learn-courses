1.3.7 Video Demonstration - Active Listening and Summarizing

Tips for Using Active Listening with a Customer

- Allow the customer to tell their problem.
- Occasionally interject some small word or phrase such as “I understand,” “Yes,” “I see,” or “Okay.” to let the customer know that you are listening.
- Summarize the customer’s problem when they are done so that you both are certain that you understand.
- Ask clarifying questions.
- Do not interrupt the customer the moment you realize you have a question.
