1.3.10 Analyze the Information
Now that the trouble ticket has been created and information has been gathered, the technician must analyze the information. To accomplish this, the technician relies on their experience, knowledge bases, and other information sources to decide if they can solve the problem. The technician may also communicate with peers to gain insight on the problem.

Knowledge bases that can be searched include:

- **Ticketing software databases** - Most ticketing systems build a repository of previous tickets that can be searched to see if another technician resolved an identical or similar problem.
- **Vendor resources** - Vendors maintain Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) documents that can be searched and may also offer online tools to help resolve problems. Some offer live chats to solve problems faster.
- **Online internet searches** - Using search engines to see if a problem has been encountered before.

If the problem cannot be solved, then the ticket must be escalated to a more experienced IT staff member.
