### 1.3.8 Gather Information for Host-Related Tickets

The ticketing system often includes sections for entering host-related information. These fields are often completed during the “Gather Information” step of the troubleshooting life cycle.

Useful host-related information include:

- Host manufacturer, model, serial number 
- Operating system version 
- Network environment (i.e., wired, wireless, …) 
- Network connectivity test results (ping, tracert, …) 

Additional information that can be captured from a host include:

- Beep codes 
- Event Viewer logs 
- Device Manager settings
- Task Manager data
- Diagnostic tool results

#### Beep Codes
![[1.3.8 Beep Codes]]

#### Event Viewer

When system, user, or software errors occur on a windows computer, the Event Viewer shown in the figure is updated with information about the errors.

The Event Viewer application records the following information about the problem:

- What problem occurred 
- Date and time of the problem 
- Severity of the problem 
- Source of the problem 
- Event ID number 
- Which user was logged in when the problem occurred 

Although the Event Viewer lists details about the error, you might need to further research the problem to determine a solution.

#### Device Manager

The Device Manager, shown in the figure, displays all the devices that are configured on a computer.

The operating system flags the devices that are not operating correctly with an error icon. A yellow triangle with an exclamation point indicates that the device is in a problem state. A red X means that the device is disabled, removed, or Windows can't locate the device. An arrow down means the device has been disabled. A yellow question mark indicates that the system does not know which driver to install for the hardware.

#### Task Manager

The Task Manager, shown in the figure, displays the applications and background processes that are currently running.

With the Task Manager, you can close applications that have stopped responding. You can also monitor the performance of the CPU and virtual memory, view all processes that are currently running, and view information about the network connections.

#### Diagnostic Tools

Conduct research to determine which software is available to help diagnose and solve problems. There are many programs to help you troubleshoot hardware. Manufacturers of system hardware usually provide diagnostic tools of their own. For instance, a hard drive manufacturer might provide a tool to boot the computer and diagnose why the hard drive does not start the operating system.
