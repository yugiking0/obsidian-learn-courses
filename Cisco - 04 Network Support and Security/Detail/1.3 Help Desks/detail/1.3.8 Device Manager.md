#### Device Manager

The Device Manager, shown in the figure, displays all the devices that are configured on a computer.

The operating system flags the devices that are not operating correctly with an error icon. A yellow triangle with an exclamation point indicates that the device is in a problem state. A red X means that the device is disabled, removed, or Windows can't locate the device. An arrow down means the device has been disabled. A yellow question mark indicates that the system does not know which driver to install for the hardware.
