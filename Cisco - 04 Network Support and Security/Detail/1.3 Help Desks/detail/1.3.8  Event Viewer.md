 Event Viewer
 
 When system, user, or software errors occur on a windows computer, the Event Viewer shown in the figure is updated with information about the errors.

The Event Viewer application records the following information about the problem:

- What problem occurred 
- Date and time of the problem 
- Severity of the problem 
- Source of the problem 
- Event ID number 
- Which user was logged in when the problem occurred 

Although the Event Viewer lists details about the error, you might need to further research the problem to determine a solution.
