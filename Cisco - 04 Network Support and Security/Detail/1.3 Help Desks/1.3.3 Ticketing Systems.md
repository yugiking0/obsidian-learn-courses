1.3.3 Ticketing Systems

Help desk ticketing systems help organizations manage user problems or requests. Ticketing software is specifically designed to ensure that corporate users or clients receive support in a timely and systematic manner. They also ensure that all tickets get noticed and addressed.

A shared mailbox is an alternative method that can be used by an organization to support user requests. Help desk technicians would all share the same mailbox and respond to emails to solve problems.

Ticketing systems vary depending on the need of the organization. For example, there are ticketing systems designed for the needs of internal corporate users and other systems to support service providers or external customers.

**Note**: A quick internet search for “help desk software” reveals many different software vendors including Zendesk, HaloITSM, Connectwise and more.

The figure shows a sample ticket designed to help you understand what information a help desk ticket could capture.

|**Description**|A free-form field that describes the request|
|**Reported by**|Free-form fields that identify who requested the support|
|**Category**|- A drop-down list for selecting pre-determined categories<br>- This is useful to group related tickets together.<br>- For example, New Device / App Request, Employee Onboarding / Termination, Support, Report a problem, and Security Incident|
|**Priority / Severity**|- A drop-down list for selecting pre-determined priority levels<br>- For example, high, medium, low, or critical, major, and minor|

In the sample ticket, some fields were system generated (in orange), drop-down (in blue), or free-form (in yellow). Drop-down fields make it easier to enter and maintain consistency. The free-form fields are used by the help desk technician to add descriptive information.

Free-form fields will be read by other technicians and managers. Therefore, it is important to use clear and concise written communication. Use plain language and short sentences. Always pay attention to your spelling, grammar, and style.
