# Wrong Fit, Right Fit: Why How We Work Matters More Than Ever
by With André Martin

## Transcript

**Rachel Salaman:** Hello, I’m Rachel Salaman. When you feel like you’re thriving at work, like you’re motivated and creative and just generally happy, can you put your finger on why? Well, my guest today, organizational psychologist André Martin PhD, thinks it comes down to fit.

In his new book, “Wrong Fit, Right Fit: Why How We Work Matters More Than Ever,” he explains what fit is and offers lots of useful exercises and assessments to help individuals find a workplace or role that fits them, while helping organizations find fitting candidates for the job. André joins me now from Portland, Oregon. Hello, André.

**André Martin:** Hello, Rachel. How are you doing?

**Rachel Salaman:** Yes, very well, thank you. So, let’s be clear right at the start: What’s the difference between "fit" and "fitting in"?

**André Martin:** In the book, I define "fit" as a deep and authentic connection to how a company works day to day. And a metaphor we use in the book is that work feels easy. It’s the equivalent of writing with your dominant hand; it’s high quality, it takes little effort or thought, you feel confident and competent when you’re doing it.

"Fitting in" is when you change the way you do work or the way you show up at work in an effort to be successful, be seen, or belong. Now, marginalized groups have faced the pressure of fitting in for decades and many smarter people than me are trying to help organizations **do much better** in this regard through the efforts of diversity, equity and inclusion.

This book tackles "fit" and "fitting in" in a nuanced and narrow way, really around how we like to work day to day, all those things around collaboration, how we solve problems, prioritize, how we see time. And, if we get those right, if we can get "fit" there, we tend to write with our dominant hand as opposed to trying to write with our non-dominant hand, which, if you’ve ever done it, it’s really hard, it’s really low quality, it’s frustrating, and you end up, over time, feeling less competent at your craft.

**Rachel Salaman:** Yes, that’s an excellent metaphor. You say in your book that "fit" matters now more than ever. What changes have you seen in the workplace that led you to that conclusion?

**André Martin:** There have been quite a few trends and disruptions to the workplace and, Rachel, the most talked about is often **COVID**. Many like to point to COVID as the great disrupter of work. But COVID wasn’t the cause. It was an important accelerator to massive changes in the way that work gets done. But if you go back even before COVID, there were these trends that were already sort of seeping their way into the dialogue.

I think the first was, sort of, the rise of the culture deck and really this movement toward companies becoming *brands and products* themselves. And you see it in these wonderful career sites, in the ways recruiters reach out, in these beautiful stories of what it’s like to work in any given organization. And, although I think the intent is really good, often the messages are much more aspirational than they are a reflection of the day-to-day in the company.

A second really important trend has just been the decade of overall growth. And so in companies we sort of lost the muscle in some key areas of building "fit" and engaging employees because we became over-dependent on extrinsic motivators – things like beautiful offices, better pay, more vacation, all those things that when you’re growing you can give a little bit more easily and a little bit more generously.

I think a third one that’s been really intriguing to me comes from a book I read by Pete Davis, called “Dedicated,” and in it he cites this idea of infinite browsing. He says that we’re living in the age of infinite browsing with all of our access to information, all of the social media that’s happening, influencers in our world.

It’s created this phenomenon where we are constantly looking for the greener grass, the better experience, where we have this intense fear of missing out, and that sort of got in the way of us really, truly committing to our companies, to our craft. And so it’s really started to contribute to a lot of movement and questioning about fit.

**Rachel Salaman:** So, is this what led you to write this book, to help people move on from that, what sounds like, somewhat of a stalemate situation? Your book is there to guide them to a place where they will perhaps stop looking?
