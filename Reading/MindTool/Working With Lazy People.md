# Working With Lazy People

Do you work with a person who doesn't "pull their weight"? Perhaps they waste a large part of the day playing games, or talking to friends on the phone. Or, maybe they take extra-long breaks, and they're happy just to do the very minimum to get by.

If you work with a colleague like this, then you know how frustrating it can be. Working with someone who's lazy is always a personal challenge, but it can also lower the productivity and morale of everyone else in the office.

However, if you're not that person's boss, is there anything that you can do? Do you simply have to tolerate this "rogue," or should you confront the situation head on?

## Your Options

If you have a lazy co-worker in your midst, you'll probably have several options.

Your first option is to ignore the situation and go about your business. If the lazy colleague isn't causing you problems in any way, this might be the best option.

Sure, it's annoying and unfair that they're getting away with only doing a fraction of the work. But eventually, their poor performance is going to catch up with them. In the meantime, let it go – focus on doing your own great work, and making sure that you get the [recognition that you deserve](https://www.mindtools.com/a5vcrux/get-the-recognition-you-deserve).

However, if your colleague's idleness is having a negative impact on your work, or that of your team mates, then you need to take action.

So another option is to pick up the work your colleague isn't doing. This will take care of neglected tasks, but it's only going to add to your [stress](https://www.mindtools.com/community/pages/main/newMN_TCS.php) and frustration, since you're now doing their job as well.

Letting your co-worker continue with their bad work habits could also cause a negative impact on your, or your team's, reputation.

Your last, and likely best, option is to get [assertive](https://www.mindtools.com/amjhdie/assertiveness) and take direct action to stop them being so lazy. We'll look at several approaches to doing this.

## Open a Dialog

Begin by meeting your co-worker privately.

First, explain how their actions are affecting you and your other team members. Cite specific dates or situations that will trigger their memory – be as detailed as you can here.

For instance, if they were supposed to prepare a presentation for last week's meeting and missed the deadline, then let them know that you had to stay late to complete their work. Making them see that theit actions (or lack thereof) are having a personal affect on you can drive the message home.

This can be a difficult conversation to have, but be respectful and polite throughout, and try to avoid [getting emotional](https://www.mindtools.com/amqbd0e/managing-your-emotions-at-work) or angry.

If you're nervous or unsure what you're going to say, then try [role playing](https://www.mindtools.com/acjtx9g/role-playing) to prepare for this meeting. You might also want to brush up on your [communication skills](https://www.mindtools.com/community/pages/main/page8.php) to make sure you can get your point across confidently and assertively.

If your co-worker regularly dumps their own responsibilities onto you, then it's time this behavior stopped. Let them know firmly that you're not going to cover for them, or take on their tasks, any longer. Stress that if their behavior doesn't change, you'll have no choice but to go to your boss.

Your co-worker might not respond positively to this conversation. So, to prepare for this, you might want to learn more about how to [deal with difficult people](https://www.mindtools.com/av60qb5/how-to-deal-with-difficult-people). If things get heated, end the conversation and walk away – nothing productive will come from arguing.

> [[info]]Tip:

Keep a private note of everything that you do and why you're doing it. If your co-worker makes a fuss about what you're doing, you need to be able to defend yourself!

## Listen Actively

You may think your co-worker is simply lazy, or that they just doesn't care.

But there might be another reason why they're not performing. Perhaps they're not in the right role and feel overwhelmed by their tasks. They might not know a certain task is their responsibility, or they might not have the skills needed to do their job effectively.

Or, they could be dealing with stressful issues such as a personal or family illness, divorce, or troubles with their children.

Ask them to explain their side of the story, and [listen actively](https://www.mindtools.com/az4wxv7/active-listening) to what they have to say. You might be surprised to find out that there's more than meets the eye. Sometimes, just being willing to listen can make a big difference.

## The Invisible Manager

Another strategy you can use is to help a lazy colleague in a subtle way. That is, you can delicately shape their behavior and motivation without them realizing what you're doing.

For example, if you think that your co-worker is unmotivated because they aren't in the right role, ask them what they'd enjoy doing. Then, try to pass along projects and tasks that would fall under their ideal role. You could also loan them books or articles that would help them develop professionally. This can get them excited about what they're doing, and improve their morale.

You can also help them to discover how to [work with purpose](https://www.mindtools.com/ac5qval/working-with-purpose) and find new meaning in what they're currently doing. Or, you could use a well-respected tool like [Schein's Career Anchors](https://www.mindtools.com/af694e5/scheins-career-anchors) to help your colleague to find inspiration and direction in the work that they're currently doing.

When your co-worker does step up and do a good job, then recognize their efforts. Often, compliments and thanks from team members can be more gratifying than those from the boss.

## Consulting Your Boss

If, in spite of your best efforts, your colleague won't improve or change, and if their laziness is still causing problems for you or your team, then you might have to speak with your boss.

Before you do this, remind your colleague again that you'll have no choice but to go to your boss if their behavior doesn't change.

In the meantime, make a note of exactly what your co-worker is (or isn't) doing. If they spend two hours at lunch and don't make up the time, write this down. If they're making personal calls, or surfing the internet, write down the times and any other relevant information.

You may want to do this over a period of a few weeks to gather enough evidence, and give your colleague a further chance to improve their behavior.

If there's still no improvement, arrange to meet with your boss. Explain the situation clearly and honestly, and detail the steps that you've taken to get your co-worker to change. Again, try to keep emotion and drama out of the conversation.

You'll also want to bring any records you have that prove that your co-worker has been shirking their duties.

Then, hand the situation over to your boss completely. After all, you've now done all you can.

#### Key Points

Working with a lazy colleague can be a challenging and frustrating experience. Lazy co-workers who don't work to the best of their ability can damage the morale of the entire team, and even cause negative repercussions in your own career.

Usually, your first step will be to meet with your colleague in private. Let them know how their poor performance is impacting your own work. You can also try to help them by subtly changing their motivation and behavior.

If, however, this approach doesn't work after you've given them several chances to improve, you'll need to hand the problem over to your boss. It's their responsibility to handle staff issues, once you've done all that you can.
