# Breaking Bad Habits

Do you have habits that harm your work, career or personal life? Maybe you can't stop checking your phone in meetings, turning up late for client visits, or putting off important tasks.

Bad habits like these can damage our reputations and hold us back in our lives and careers, so it's vital that we learn how to deal with them.

In this article, we examine why we develop habits in the first place, and explore ways to rid ourselves of the unhelpful ones.

## Understanding Habits

Psychologists define habits as acquired behaviors or thought patterns, which we repeat so often that they become automatic. We develop habits because they free up our brains to do other things that require our focused attention.

Positive habits, such as waking up on time, help us to live and work more efficiently, but bad habits can have the opposite effect.

It's often hard to spot them, because they're unconscious and automatic. And bad habits can be difficult to break, because they usually start out as enjoyable or stress-relieving activities that we want to repeat.

The good news is that you can break bad habits. It just takes a little time and effort.

## How to Change Your Habits

Chances are, you have a bad habit that you'd like to beat. It could be overeating, excessive screen time, not getting enough sleep, [saying "yes" too often](https://www.mindtools.com/aksps8d/yes-to-the-person-no-to-the-task), missing deadlines, [procrastinating](https://www.mindtools.com/community/pages/article/newHTE_96.php), breaking promises, or [giving in to anger](https://www.mindtools.com/a77mkcz/how-good-is-your-anger-management), for example.

At first, these behaviors may not bother you. But, eventually, you reach a breaking point where "enough is enough." Maybe your habit is starting to impact your co-workers or your family. Or, perhaps you suddenly realize that your habit is preventing you from achieving your career goals. Whatever the reason, there's no bad time to break a bad habit.
