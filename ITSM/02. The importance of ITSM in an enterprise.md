### The importance of ITSM in an enterprise

ITSM is advantageous for the IT department, and service management practices may benefit the organization as a whole. It increases efficiency and production. A systematic management method also aligns IT with business objectives by standardizing service delivery depending on finances, resources, and outcomes. It saves expenses and hazards and eventually enhances customer satisfaction.

The top three justifications for using ITSM are:

1. **Minimizing the risk from digital disruption**

The risk associated with any transition may seem catastrophically high, especially if the transformation is inadequately conceived, evaluated, or conveyed to the company and team members. With ITSM, the likelihood of large service or business outages is drastically minimized. Formalized rules, procedures, and responsibilities facilitate effective communication with customers and other stakeholders.

2. **Managing costs while scaling**

As organizations expand in size and complexity, IT departments must recruit additional personnel or risk being overburdened with tactical and operational activities. IT service management may facilitate the scalability of IT operations without the need for additional staffing, owing to automation tools that decrease IT operators’ manual intervention.

3. **Driving visibility and accountability**

ITSM helps IT administrators to monitor the resolution of events and service requests. It provides transparency into the way the IT group provides services. IT managers may check incident logs to ensure services are offered consistently and following company rules and procedures. In addition, they may monitor business activities on the company’s network and identify policy violations.

Currently, information technologies include and integrate duties and responsibilities from all areas of a business. Customers anticipate that companies are competent enough to manage these services on an ongoing basis. Businesses rely on IT Service Management (ITSM) to successfully organize these operations and procedures while guaranteeing that they provide genuine customer value.

### The evolution of modern ITSM

One may trace the first application of ITSM principles to when IT companies utilized massive mainframe infrastructures. Over time, the technology and the functions reached a high degree of maturity. Managing change, production scheduling, configuration, recovery procedures, performance management, and availability management are among the most outstanding examples of ITSM approaches.

The critical distinction between mainframe settings of the past and ITSM practices of today is that mainframes often used a centralized system. One may, nonetheless, use ITSM for both centralized and decentralized systems. In addition, mainframe technology was mostly technology-based and provided as stand-alone practices, while ITSM focused on various integrated services to meet business objectives.

ITSM is closely associated with ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library). ITIL is the official document of the Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, and it addresses several related issues as independent disciplines. The most recent edition of ITIL is its 4th edition, which introduces significant enhancements over the 2011 edition, which is a modification of the 2007 edition.

### Top information technology service management (ITSM) frameworks

Let us now examine the various ITSM frameworks currently in use:

- **MOF:** The Microsoft Operations Framework (MOF) is a collection of 23 publications that describe the procedures for developing, delivering, and maintaining IT services. The overarching objective of the MOF is to provide an environment where IT and business may collaborate effectively toward operational maturity.
- **COBIT:** COBIT, an acronym for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies, provides tools for constructing, monitoring, and enhancing the implementation and risk management solutions. The COBIT Core Model has forty goals for governance and management.
- **TOGAF:** The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF) is a structure and technique designed to identify business objectives and connect them with software development-related architecture objectives. This 1996-created high-level architecture continues to demonstrate its relevance in the [DevOps](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/devops/articles/what-is-devops/ "DevOps") age.
- **ITIL:** ITIL, launched in the 1980s, offers businesses guidance on using technology for transformational change, development, and innovation. ITIL 4 provides the service management skills necessary to adapt IT to cloud, [Agile, and DevOps](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/devops/articles/devops-vs-agile/ "Agile, and DevOps") scenarios.
