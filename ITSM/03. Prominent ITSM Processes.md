## Prominent ITSM Processes 

The stages of a service’s life cycle, from conception through delivery, are often referred to as ITSM processes. These are the ten most essential ITSM procedures one must understand:

### 1. Incident management

ITIL defines an incident as “an unanticipated interruption or degradation of an IT service”. In addition, it highlights that an incident could also include something that is not apparent to the user, such as a component failure identified by systems monitoring tools. The primary objective of this procedure is to return the service to regular functioning as rapidly as possible while minimizing the effect on business activities. Consequently, the SLA must define “normal operation.”

### 2. Change management

This is one of the most critical processes for enhancing the availability of your IT services. Before any modification, big or small, can be made to the IT Service, it must be planned and well-considered, and one must understand the ramifications. This does not imply that one must slow down changes since the process may be adjusted to each company’s requirements, but it does imply that each change is examined in some way before being implemented. This alone results in fewer errors, enhancing your IT services’ availability.

### 3. Service order fulfillment

The delivery of software licenses and hardware components must be expedited so that customers may perform their duties or become productive promptly after joining a company. In addition to controlling expenses, businesses must ensure they only purchase what is necessary and do not have depreciating licenses or hardware lying on the shelf. An efficient fulfillment process may prevent this from occurring and guarantee the proper monitoring of assets.

### 4. Service level agreement (SLA) management

It is essential to understand the business’s IT service requirements. Uncertainty may indicate that the service offered is not supporting the company and that the IT services being delivered exceed its current needs. Both of these might incur costs for a company. This procedure enables the implementation of the appropriate [service level agreements (SLAs)](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/cloud/articles/what-is-a-service-level-agreement/ "service level agreements (SLAs)") to guarantee that the IT service fulfills business requirements.

### 5. Access management

This method involves account credentials. Because password renewals are the most frequent requests within access management, automating the fulfillment of such requests may allow an organization with, say, 600,000 yearly password resets to save up to $1,850,000 per year. Such cost reductions are frequent among businesses with robust ITSM installation.

### 6. Continual service improvement (CSI)

Successfully implementing IT procedures should not be the ultimate stage for any organization. There is always space for growth and improvement depending on challenges that arise, client requests, and user input. Metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) are crucial in identifying improvement or change areas. IT teams may embrace processes such as IT service appraisals, process assessments, and CSI project management as a component of CSI.

### 7. Demand and capacity planning

This ITSM process is designed to examine and forecast upcoming requirements for the defined IT services and ensure that sufficient IT resources are readily available to meet current and future corporate needs at a reasonable cost. It is closely linked to financial management, which manages the company’s IT budget, expenditure, and other financials, as well as IT service portfolio or catalog management. 

### 8. Supplier management

Businesses need to monitor their vendors: are they performing well? Will they remain in existence next year? Are they providing the support and quality that the company requires? Are you spending money on solutions people no longer need? A solid supplier management approach allows businesses to answer these and other questions. It also enables companies to present the vendor with a blueprint of the organization’s plans, allowing them to serve future demands better. If one manages the partnership proactively, one should seldom need to impose SLA penalties.

### 9. Problem management

Discovering and addressing the causes of problems in an IT service is known as problem management. It is not only a matter of locating and resolving occurrences but also of recognizing and comprehending the underlying reasons for an incident and determining the most effective way to eliminate that root cause. One may resolve the issue after service is restored, but the problem persists till root causes and contributory factors are addressed. Consequently, issue management should be an ongoing and widespread process across many teams, including IT, [cybersecurity](https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/vulnerability-management/articles/what-is-cybersecurity/ "cybersecurity"), and software developers.

### 10. Knowledge management

Knowledge management is collecting, assessing, storing, and disseminating IT service desk knowledge. It is meant to help service desk teams make the appropriate choices throughout the service life cycle and issue resolution process by regulating and managing the flow of information effectively. ITIL4 identifies knowledge management as the critical process that delivers insights to all other ITSM operations.
